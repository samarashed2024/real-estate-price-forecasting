# Smart Real Estate Price Prediction System
Final project for the Building AI course

## Summary
An intelligent system that uses machine learning techniques to predict real estate prices in the Egyptian and Arab markets based on multiple factors such as location, area, number of rooms, and surrounding amenities. The project aims to help buyers and sellers make informed decisions.

*Modern real estate market analysis*

## Background
The real estate market in Egypt and the Arab region faces several challenges in accurately valuing properties:

* Lack of unified standards for property valuation
* Large price variations between different areas
* Difficulty predicting market trends
* Limited transparency in fair price determination
* Need for specialized expertise to evaluate properties

My personal motivation for this project is to help people make informed real estate decisions and reduce financial risks. This topic is important because real estate represents the largest investment in most people's lives.

## How is it used?
The system works as follows:

1. **Data Input**: User enters property details (location, area, number of rooms, etc.)
2. **Smart Analysis**: System analyzes data using machine learning models
3. **Prediction**: System provides expected price with confidence interval
4. **Recommendations**: Offers advice for buying or selling

**Target Users**:
- First-time property buyers
- Real estate investors
- Real estate agents
- Banks and financing companies

The solution is needed in situations where quick and accurate property valuation is required, especially in volatile markets or when dealing with unique properties.

*Mobile application interface design*

**Code Example**:

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor
from sklearn.metrics import mean_absolute_error

def predict_property_price(location, area, rooms, bathrooms, age, amenities):
    """
    Predict property price using Random Forest model
    """
    # Prepare features
    features = np.array([[location, area, rooms, bathrooms, age, amenities]])
    
    # Load pre-trained model
    model = load_trained_model()
    
    # Make prediction
    predicted_price = model.predict(features)[0]
    
    return predicted_price

def main():
    # Example usage
    locations = ['New_Cairo', 'Maadi', 'Nasr_City', 'Zamalek', 'Sheikh_Zayed']
    
    # Example property
    location_code = 1  # New Cairo
    area = 120  # square meters
    rooms = 3
    bathrooms = 2
    age = 5  # years
    amenities_score = 8  # out of 10
    
    predicted_price = predict_property_price(
        location_code, area, rooms, bathrooms, age, amenities_score
    )
    
    print(f"Predicted property price: {predicted_price:,.0f} EGP")
    print(f"Price per square meter: {predicted_price/area:,.0f} EGP/mÂ²")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
